I took Girls Who Code Introduction to HTML and CSS course and created a personality quiz featuring my own artwork I drew on Krita. 

Through this project, I was able to utilized Javascript to create interactive buttons that help tally up and determine the user's final answer. I also learned more about flexbox which
allowed me to organize my images and add to the cohesion of the website.

Originally, only the text will change when the user finished answering the questions
with all the different possible image results lined up in a row underneath. I decided to revisit this and added to the Javascript so now the results have corresponding individualized images which will also disappears if the restart button is pressed. This improves user experience as each quiz feels more personalized and it incentivizes users to retake the quiz to see different results.
